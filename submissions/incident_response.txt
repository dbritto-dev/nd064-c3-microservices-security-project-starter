1. Incident commander name:
Danilo Britto

2. Executive Summary of what happened: 
Three pods are deployed using an insecure docker image with crypto-mining code and the pod names are: 
cryptotonight, minergate and moneropool.

3. Summary of what was affected:
some parts in our cluster was affected by these dangerous pods. The resource consumption was increase, 
some critical information was exposed and some files was corrupted/modified intentionally.

4. Summary of the impact:
due to some some dangerous pod we got into an outage of all our services.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
Using kube-bench and docker-bench we was able to identify what's happening and using CIS Docker Benchmark
and CIS Rancher Benchmark we was able to apply some remediations and solve the flaws in our current
implementation and stack. 

6. Summary of lessons learned:
We should always review what kind of docker image we're using and what kind of code they are running. 
Also, we should always check the Falco Dashboard in Grafana. Admission controllers can also be 
configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
