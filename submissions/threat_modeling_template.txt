Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

- Elevation of privilege: when a Dockerfile does not specify a user, it defaults to executing the container using the root user, affecting client authorization and the Dockerfile.
- Information Disclosure: the client may expose sensitive information such as secrets that are hardcoded in configuration files that could impact the security of the Dockerfile.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

```sh
./docker-bench --include-test-output | grep FAIL
```

- [FAIL] 3.19 Ensure that /etc/default/docker file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)

**Audit:**

```sh
stat -c %U:%G /etc/default/docker | grep -v root:root
```

**Remediation:**

```sh
sudo chown root:root /etc/default/docker
```

- [FAIL] 3.22 Ensure that /etc/default/docker file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated)

**Audit:**

```sh
stat -c %a /etc/default/docker
```

**Remediation:**

```sh
sudo chmod 644 /etc/default/docker
```

- [FAIL] 4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)

**Audit:**

```sh
echo $DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST 
```

**Remediation:**

```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```
