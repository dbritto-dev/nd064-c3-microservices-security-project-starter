1. How will you test the changes:

We can use kube-bench to get all the failed findings in our cluster and using it to can go through
of each point and apply some remediation for each point using CIS Rancher Benchmark and then we can 
use kube-bench again to get all the new failed findings and checking if the number of failed findings was
decreased. We can continuously doing these until we don't get more failed findings.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

Using observability tools (Prometheus, Jaeger and Grafana) we can monitor if the system was not affected 
due the changes for increase the security in our apps.

Using tracing stuff like Jaeger we can have all the necessary information to go trough each error and
see what and when is happening.

Using monitoring stuff like Prometheus we can have all the necessary information about our servers/instances
and check what and when is happening.
